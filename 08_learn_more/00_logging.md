$this->logger->info('foobar');
```

The `notice` method is used to log normal but significant events.

```

The `warning` method is used to log exceptional occurrences that are not errors.

```

```

The `error` method is used to log runtime errors that do not require immediate action but should typically be logged and monitored.

```

The `critical` method is used log to critical conditions.

```
$this->logger->critical('foobar');
