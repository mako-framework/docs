The configuration of the Mako core is done in the `app/init.php` file. This is where you set the error reporting level and define the paths to the application and vendor directories.

All of the remaining framework configuration is done by editing the files that are located in the `app/config` directory.

## Config Files

Mako config files are just simple arrays:

```php
<?php

return
[
	'key_1' => 'value',
	'key_2' => 'value',
];
```

And loading a config file is done by using the `get` method.

```php
$config = $this->config->get('redis'); // Loads the redis.php file
```

You can also fetch config items using `dot notation`.

```php
$default = $this->config->get('redis.default');
```

It is also possible to override settings or add new configurations at runtime:

```php
// Adds a new Crypto configuration named "user" that you can
// use when creating a Crypto instance "Crypto::instance('user');"

$this->config->set('crypto.configurations.user',
[
	'library'  => 'openssl',
	'cipher'   => 'AES-256-OFB',
	'key'     => 'ksMGBr_yR>=IiRicJFUhD4XlRnE%|11mvRGNJsD',
]);
```

Removing the custom configuration is done using the `remove` method:

```php
$this->config->remove('crypto.configurations.user');
```

> Setting configuration at runtime is not always possible. Some components such as the connections managers (database, redis, etc...) will cache the settings once they get loaded. You can override them using their `addConfiguration` and `removeConfiguration` methods instead.

## Cascading configuration

Sometimes you might want to edit the configuration files of a third party package. You can edit the package config file directly but the changes you make will be overwritten when you update the package. This is where cascading config files come become handy.

Lets say you have a packaged named `foobar` with a config file. Just copy the file into `app/config/packages/foobar` and the application will load that file instead of the one located in the package. This makes it possible to update the package while keeping your custom settings.

## Environment aware configuration

Mako supports environment aware configuration. This means that you can have separate configuration files for your different environments. All you have to do is create a subdirectory with the name of your environment in the `app/config` directory and copy the environment specific files into it.

Setting the environment in Apache:

```none
SetEnv MAKO_ENV dev
```

Setting the environment in Nginx:

```nginx
fastcgi_param MAKO_ENV dev;
```

Setting the environment in a linux/unix shell:

```bash
export MAKO_ENV=dev # for Bourne, bash, and related shells
setenv MAKO_ENV=dev # for csh and related shells
```

You can also manually set the environment in the CLI using the env option.

```bash
php reactor <command> --env=dev
```
