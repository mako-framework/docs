# Sentry

--------------------------------------------------------

* [Installation](#installation)

--------------------------------------------------------

The [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) integration package allows to you to log debug information and exceptions to Sentry.

--------------------------------------------------------

### <a id="installation" href="#installation">Installation</a>

Install the package using the following composer command:

```
composer require mako/sentry
```
{.language-none}

Next you'll have to add a `logger.sentry` config key to your `application.php` config file.

```
'logger' =>
[
	...
	'sentry' =>
	[
		'dsn' => 'https://<key>@sentry.io/<project>',
	],
	...
],
```

Then you'll have to replace the default `LoggerService` with the included `LoggerService` in the `application.php` config file.

```
'services' =>
[
	'core' =>
	[
		...
		mako\sentry\services\LoggerService::class,
		...
	],
],
```

And finally you'll have to enable logging to sentry by setting the `logger.handler` key in the `application.php` config file to the following value:

```
'logger' =>
[
	...
	'handler' => ['Sentry', 'Stream'],
	...
],
```

> Note that you can disable the default file logging by setting the value to `['Sentry']`.
